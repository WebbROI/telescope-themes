### About The Theme

The Telescope Iris theme is inspired by the beautiful design of [Crater.io](https://crater.io/) website made by [Nick Wientge](http://exygen.io/). Thus, the theme has been designed to use the "List" post list layout. Although, it should work just as fine with the "Grid" layout.

The theme is named after a NASA solar observation satellite called Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). [Learn more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_Region_Imaging_Spectrograph).
